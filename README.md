# 🌤️ Weather App

This is my first project — a simple weather app that shows real-time weather information. Users can get the weather based on their location or by searching for a city. It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the OpenWeatherMap API to display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
